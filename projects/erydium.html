</center>
  
  <p1 style="color:white;"> This is the ERYDIUM  guitar pedal. I've made it as my last electronics project at Summa Engineering. It showcases different circuits that combine to create certain functions. The general functions are:  </p1>
<ul style="color:white;">
  <li>Analog PWM through primitive triangle wave generation with OPAMPs.</li>
  <li>Guitar signal amplitude driven LEDs which light up when guitar is played.</li>
  <li>Variable frequency blockwave generator made with analog switches to make an electric guitar effect with audio artifacts through aliasing.</li>
  <li>Distortion effect with multiple transistor stages and potentiometer inputs which affect tone, distortion level etc.</li>
</ul>
